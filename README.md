# HyperShift Test Results & Verification

Centralized repository for HyperShift test plans and pre-merge verification
reports. Replaces the previous pattern of self-hosting these artifacts in
individual personal GitHub repositories.

### Plans (`plans/`)

Each test plan is a single Markdown file following the IEEE 829-2008 standard.
A single plan can reference multiple Jira issues and PRs to support backport
workflows. See [docs/format.md](docs/format.md#naming-conventions) for naming
conventions and the metadata model.

### Reports (`reports/`)

Verification reports capture the results of executing a test plan against a
specific PR. Reports are grouped into subdirectories named by Jira issue key.

Reports support **two formats**:

- **HTML bundle (preferred)** — a self-contained directory with `index.html`,
  per-scenario pages (`scenario-N.html`), appendices, automated-test results,
  images, and helper scripts. This is the existing format used by OCPBUGS and
  CNTRLPLANE verification reports.
- **Markdown** — a lightweight single-file report (`<pr-number>.md`) following
  the template in [docs/format.md](docs/format.md#markdown-report-template).

> **Format policy:** HTML bundles are stored as-is; they must **not** be
> converted to Markdown during migration. An IEEE 829 Markdown summary _may_
> optionally be derived from an HTML bundle (placed in `derived/report.md`),
> but derivation must not replace or discard the original HTML.

### Documentation (`docs/`)

- **[docs/format.md](docs/format.md)** — Metadata model, naming conventions,
  format specification, and relationship model (1-to-N Jira/PR support).
- **[docs/migration.md](docs/migration.md)** — Guide for migrating existing
  test plans from personal repositories, including a migration inventory.

## Quick Start

1. Read the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. Review the [format specification](docs/format.md) for metadata requirements.
3. Copy an existing plan from `plans/` or use the template in
   [docs/format.md](docs/format.md#plan-template).
4. Open a PR adding your plan or report.

## Automation Integration

This repository is designed for integration with
[Chai Bot](https://github.com/openshift/ai-helpers) and the `ai-helpers`
skill library. The target workflow:

```
@chai-bot make a test plan for JIRA-1234 and add it to test-results-verification
```

See [docs/format.md](docs/format.md#automation-integration-contract) for the
integration contract that automation must follow when generating or updating
plans.

> **Status:** Automation integration is tracked in
> [CNTRLPLANE-4323](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNTRLPLANE-4323).
> The contract is documented; implementation in the `ai-helpers` skill
> library is a follow-up.
