# Format Specification

This document defines the metadata model, naming conventions, file format, and
relationship model for test plans and verification reports in this repository.

## Naming Conventions

### Plans

| Situation | Pattern | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Linked to a Jira issue | `plans/<jira-key>.md` | `plans/ocpstrat-3298.md` |
| No Jira issue | `plans/<descriptive-slug>.md` | `plans/csi-snapshot-validation.md` |

Rules:

- Filenames are **lowercase**.
- Jira keys use the original project prefix and number (e.g. `ocpstrat-3298`,
  `cntrlplane-1234`, `ocpbugs-5678`).
- Slugs for plans without a Jira issue use lowercase words separated by
  hyphens. Keep them short and descriptive.
- Files prefixed with `_` (e.g. `_example.md`) are reserved for templates
  and reference examples. They are not production plans.
- One plan per file. Do not combine unrelated features.

### Reports

Reports support two formats. Choose based on the report content:

#### HTML-bundle reports (preferred)

```
reports/<jira-key>/
├── index.html              # Dashboard / entry-point
├── scenario-1.html         # Per-scenario detail pages
├── scenario-2.html
├── ...
├── appendices.html          # Environment details, config evidence
├── automated-tests.html     # CI / automated-test results
├── assets/                  # Screenshots, diagrams
│   └── img-scenario-1.png
├── scripts/                 # Helper scripts used in testing
│   └── setup-env.sh
└── derived/                 # Optional IEEE 829 Markdown summary
    └── report.md
```

Example: `reports/ocpbugs-100054/index.html` is the entry-point for the
OCPBUGS-100054 verification report.

HTML bundles are self-contained directories mirroring the existing
`test-verification-report-*` pattern from the source repository. Each
bundle typically includes:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.html` | Dashboard with navigation, summary statistics, and links to scenario pages |
| `scenario-N.html` | Detailed steps, evidence, and pass/fail status for each test scenario |
| `appendices.html` | Environment details, configuration dumps, supplementary evidence |
| `automated-tests.html` | CI pipeline results, automated-test logs, coverage data |
| `assets/` | Screenshots, topology diagrams, and other images referenced by HTML pages |
| `scripts/` | Helper shell scripts, OIDC token scripts, setup utilities used during testing |
| `derived/report.md` | Optional IEEE 829 Markdown generated from the HTML (see [Derived Markdown](#derived-markdown-from-html-reports)) |

#### Markdown reports

```
reports/<jira-key>/<pr-number>.md
```

Example: `reports/ocpstrat-3298/8698.md` verifies PR #8698 against the
test plan for OCPSTRAT-3298.

Use Markdown reports for lightweight, single-PR verification results that
do not require the full HTML bundle structure.

## Metadata Block

Every plan file **must** begin with a YAML front-matter block. This block
enables automation to discover, index, and link plans.

### Required Fields

```yaml
---

### Status Lifecycle

> **Note:** The `status` field and its lifecycle values are **repository
> metadata conventions** used for workflow and discoverability — they are
> _not_ part of the IEEE 829-2008 standard. Everything in the
> [Metadata Block](#metadata-block) (the YAML front-matter) is repository
> housekeeping; the IEEE 829 content begins in the
> [Plan Body Structure](#plan-body-structure) section below.

```
draft → active → superseded
                → archived
```

- **draft** — plan is under review or incomplete.
- **active** — plan is approved and in use for verification.
- **superseded** — replaced by a newer plan (set `superseded_by`).
- **archived** — no longer relevant (feature removed, etc.).

## One-to-Many Relationships

### One Plan, Many Jira Issues (Backports)

> **Why this matters:** In practice, a feature lands on the main branch and
> is then cherry-picked to one or more release branches. Each backport
> carries its own Jira issue and PR, yet the verification logic is
> identical. Maintaining a single authoritative test plan — instead of
> copying it per-backport — prevents duplicated plans from drifting out of
> sync and gives reviewers one place to check. The metadata lists below let
> automation and reviewers trace every related Jira issue and PR back to
> that single plan.

A feature implemented in a main-branch PR often gets backported to one or
more release branches. Each backport has its own Jira issue and PR, but the
test plan is the same. Rather than duplicating the plan file, list all
related Jira issues and PRs in the metadata:

```yaml
jira_issues:
  - key: OCPSTRAT-3298
    role: primary
    url: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPSTRAT-3298
  - key: OCPBUGS-45678
    role: backport
    url: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-45678
  - key: OCPBUGS-45679
    role: backport
    url: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-45679

pull_requests:
  - repo: openshift/hypershift
    number: 8698
    url: https://github.com/openshift/hypershift/pull/8698
    role: implementation
  - repo: openshift/hypershift
    number: 8750
    url: https://github.com/openshift/hypershift/pull/8750
    role: backport
```

The plan file is named after the **primary** Jira issue key.

### One Plan, Many PRs (Same Feature)

Some features span multiple PRs (e.g. API change + controller + tests).
List all PRs in the `pull_requests` field.

### Plans Without a Jira Issue

If there is no Jira issue, leave `jira_issues` as an empty list and name
the file with a descriptive slug:

```yaml
jira_issues: []
pull_requests:
  - repo: openshift/hypershift
    number: 9100
    url: https://github.com/openshift/hypershift/pull/9100
    role: implementation
```

## Plan Body Structure

Plans should follow the IEEE 829-2008 standard structure. The recommended
sections are:

1. **Test Plan Identifier** — ID, version, date, IEEE 829 reference
2. **Introduction and Objectives** — purpose, objectives, acceptance criteria
   mapping, automation-first principle
3. **Test Items and References** — implementation PRs, code paths, API
   changes, related documentation
4. **Test Environment** — cluster types, platforms, prerequisites
5. **Test Cases** — numbered cases with preconditions, steps, expected results,
   and automation references
6. **Risks and Mitigations** — known risks and contingency plans
7. **Approvals** — sign-off section

This structure is a guideline. Adapt sections as needed for the feature under
test — not every plan needs every section.

## Report Formats

Verification reports support two formats depending on the complexity and
origin of the report content.

### HTML-Bundle Reports (Preferred)

HTML bundles are the **default and preferred** format for verification
reports. They preserve the rich, navigable structure of generated test
reports — including dashboards, per-scenario evidence pages, embedded
screenshots, and CI result summaries.

#### HTML-bundle metadata

HTML-bundle reports use a `metadata.yaml` file (not YAML front-matter)
placed at the root of the report directory:

```yaml
# reports/ocpbugs-100054/metadata.yaml
plan: ""                             # Filename stem of the test plan (if any)
jira_key: OCPBUGS-100054
format: html-bundle                  # "html-bundle" or "markdown"
date: 2026-08-05
verdict: pass                        # "pass", "fail", or "conditional"
scenario_count: 8                    # Total test scenarios
pass_count: 8                        # Scenarios that passed
ci_verified: true                    # automated-tests.html present?
has_derived_markdown: false          # derived/report.md present?
tags:
  - authentication
  - hypershift
```

#### Sanitized HTML-bundle layout example

Below is a representative directory layout for an HTML-bundle report.
All names, data, and identifiers are fictional.

```
reports/ocpbugs-99999/
├── metadata.yaml             # Required report metadata
├── index.html                # Dashboard: 6 scenarios, 6/6 pass
├── scenario-1.html           # Cluster provisioning validation
├── scenario-2.html           # Network-policy enforcement
├── scenario-3.html           # Ingress-controller health
├── scenario-4.html           # Node scaling operations
├── scenario-5.html           # Upgrade rollout verification
├── scenario-6.html           # Teardown and cleanup
├── appendices.html           # Environment config, cluster version
├── automated-tests.html      # CI job results, e2e pass rates
├── assets/
│   ├── img-s1-cluster.png    # Screenshot: cluster overview
│   └── img-s3-ingress.png    # Screenshot: ingress status
└── scripts/
    └── setup-env.sh           # Cluster environment bootstrap
```

#### `index.html` conventions

The index page serves as the report dashboard. It typically includes:

- **Navigation bar** linking to all scenario pages, appendices, and
  automated-test results.
- **Summary statistics** (total scenarios, pass/fail counts, coverage).
- **Test-environment overview** (cluster version, platform, topology).
- **Jira-key reference** in the page title or header.

HTML reports may reference external CDN resources (e.g. Bootstrap CSS/JS)
for styling but must not depend on resources outside the bundle for
_content_ (evidence, logs, screenshots).

#### Scenario pages

Each `scenario-N.html` page documents a single test scenario:

- **Objective** — what is being verified.
- **Pre-conditions** — cluster state, configuration, prerequisites.
- **Steps** — numbered test steps with expected vs. actual results.
- **Evidence** — embedded or linked screenshots, log snippets.
- **Verdict** — PASS / FAIL / SKIP with notes.

#### Assets and scripts

- Store images in `assets/` and reference them with relative paths.
- Store helper scripts in `scripts/`. Scripts must be sanitized
  (no embedded credentials, tokens, or customer identifiers).
- Large binary assets (> 5 MB per file) should be avoided; link to
  external storage if necessary.

### Derived Markdown from HTML Reports

When an IEEE 829 Markdown version of an HTML report is needed (e.g. for
downstream tooling or cross-referencing with plans), place it in
`derived/report.md` inside the report directory.

Rules:

1. The HTML bundle remains the **authoritative** artifact.
2. `derived/report.md` is a convenience copy — it may be AI-generated
   or hand-written.
3. Set `has_derived_markdown: true` in `metadata.yaml` when present.
4. Derivation **must not** replace or remove the original HTML files.

### Markdown Report Template

Markdown reports are lightweight, single-file reports for simpler
verification results. Use this format when the report does not require
a full HTML bundle.

````markdown
---
plan: ocpstrat-3298              # Filename stem of the test plan
jira_key: OCPSTRAT-3298
format: markdown                 # "html-bundle" or "markdown"
pr:
  repo: openshift/hypershift
  number: 8698
  url: https://github.com/openshift/hypershift/pull/8698
date: YYYY-MM-DD
tester: ""
verdict: pass                    # "pass", "fail", or "conditional"
---

# Verification Report: PR #8698

## Automation Integration Contract

This section defines the contract that automation tools (e.g. Chai Bot,
ai-helpers skills) must follow when creating or updating plans and reports
in this repository.

### Creating a Plan

Automation **must**:

1. Generate a valid Markdown file with the required YAML front-matter
   metadata block.
2. Use the correct filename convention (`plans/<jira-key>.md` or
   `plans/<slug>.md`).
3. Follow the IEEE 829-2008 body structure.
4. Set `status: draft` for newly generated plans.
5. Include all known Jira issues and PRs in the metadata.
6. Open a PR against `main` with title format
   `<JIRA-KEY>: Add test plan for <feature>`.

Automation **must not**:

- Commit directly to `main` — always use a PR.
- Include secrets, credentials, customer data, or private links.
- Overwrite an existing plan without incrementing the `version` field and
  updating the `date`.
- Create duplicate plan files for backport Jira issues — instead, update
  the existing plan's `jira_issues` list.

### Updating a Plan

When adding a backport Jira issue or PR to an existing plan, automation
should:

1. Read the existing plan file.
2. Append the new Jira issue or PR to the appropriate list.
3. Increment the `version` field.
4. Update the `date` field.
5. Open a PR with the changes.

### Creating a Report

For **HTML-bundle reports**, automation should:

1. Create the directory `reports/<jira-key>/`.
2. Copy the HTML bundle files (`index.html`, `scenario-*.html`,
   `appendices.html`, `automated-tests.html`, assets, scripts) into
   the directory.
3. Generate a `metadata.yaml` file with required fields (see
   [HTML-bundle metadata](#html-bundle-metadata)).
4. Set `format: html-bundle` in the metadata.

For **Markdown reports**, automation should follow the Markdown report
template defined above and place the file at
`reports/<jira-key>/<pr-number>.md`.

### File Validation

Automation should validate before committing:

- YAML front-matter is parseable.
- Required metadata fields are present.
- All URLs are well-formed.
- Filename matches the primary Jira key or slug.
- No secrets or private content patterns detected.

> **Note:** Implementation of these automation capabilities in the
> `ai-helpers` skill library is tracked as a follow-up to
> [CNTRLPLANE-4323](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNTRLPLANE-4323).
> The contract above is stable and ready for implementation.
